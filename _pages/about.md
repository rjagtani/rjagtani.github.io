Hi, I'm Rohit Jagtani, a graduate of the Elite Master's Program in Data Science from LMU Munich, with 4 years of industry experience as a Data Scientist.

## Research Focus
My research focuses on advancing Explainable AI methods in complex environments, particularly non-stationary settings and Federated Learning. I aim to develop novel XAI frameworks that provide clear, interpretable insights into AI models operating in dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous data environments. 

I'm also passionate about causality, personalized federated learning, and tackling the challenges of uncertainty quantification and fairness in machine learning models. By bridging these topics, my goal is to create robust AI systems that are transparent, fair, and trustworthy, enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios such as healthcare and other critical domains.
